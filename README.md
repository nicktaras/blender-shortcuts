# handy tips

Limited Desolve:

Reduces detail on planar faces and linear edges with an adjustable angle threshold. Always dissolve vertices that have two edge users at boundaries. Prevent faces from joining when they don't share certain properties (material for e.g.).

Tip - This is a great tool when you want to remove all inner connected vertices (line fills).

Non manifold:

Ensure that all of the mesh is complete / no gaps are present. This function can be found in the select menu.
