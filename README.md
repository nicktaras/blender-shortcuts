# blender-shortcuts (advanced)

- When creating an object and using the mirror modifier, using the LEFT Mouse + G will adjust the clipping area accordingly. (Available in latest version of Blender).

# Modifiers

Subsurf - Subdivision Surface Modifier. It smoothes your object and adds more detail.
Mirror - When creating object with symmetry e.g. an owl with two legs. You can create one leg, then add the mirror modifier, then select mirror object as the owls body object. This will place the leg in the right location automatically. 

# handy tips

Limited Desolve:

Reduces detail on planar faces and linear edges with an adjustable angle threshold. Always dissolve vertices that have two edge users at boundaries. Prevent faces from joining when they don't share certain properties (material for e.g.).

Tip - This is a great tool when you want to remove all inner connected vertices (line fills).

Non manifold:

Ensure that all of the mesh is complete / no gaps are present. This function can be found in the select menu.
